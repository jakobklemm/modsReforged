A command line mod list generator for Arma Reforger. 

* How to use
#+begin_src bash
modsReforged --path "/absolute/path/to/your/mod/install/folder/"
#+end_src
The absolute path to your mod install folder is required. On windows
this is normally under =Documents/My Games/ArmaReforger/addons/=.
* Output
The CLI will printout both a formatted and a compact JSON string. This
is intended to be used in the Reforger Sever Config. The minimized
version can directly be used in Pterodactyl.
